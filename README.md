# Screenshot application using python

## Install
Installing PyAutoGui module
 ```python
 pip install pyautogui
 ```
## Usage 

PyAutoGui lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications.
PyAutoGUI has several features:
 - Moving the mouse and clicking or typing in the windows of other applications.
 - Sending keystrokes to applications (for example, to fill out forms).
 - Take screenshots, and given an image (for example, of a button or checkbox), find it on the screen.
 - Locate an applicationâ€™s window, and move, resize, maximize, minimize, or close it (Windows-only, currently)
 - Display message boxes for user interaction while your GUI automation script runs.
